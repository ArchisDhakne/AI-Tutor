# 📚 AI-Tutor: Learn at Your Own Pace with Personalized AI

AI-Tutor is a personal AI-powered learning platform built exclusively to teach **NCERT syllabus** (starting with Class 10)(AS OF NOW) in a more personalized, pressure-free environment.

## 🎯 Vision

Millions of students in India struggle with one key problem: **personalized doubt-solving and learning pace**. In large classrooms (online or offline), teachers cannot cater to individual doubts, especially when students feel shy or anxious asking basic questions. This leads to a knowledge gap and a lack of confidence.

**AI-Tutor changes that.**

## 🧠 How It Works

- **AI as Your Personal Tutor**  
  Every student gets a 24x7 AI tutor that teaches them based on their current understanding, speed, and intelligence level.

- **NCERT-Focused**  
  The AI will follow the NCERT curriculum strictly — covering each chapter with:
  - Conceptual videos (AI-generated)
  - Practice exercises
  - Instant doubt resolution
  - Adaptive teaching based on performance

- **Smart Learning Engine**  
  The AI will observe:
  - How fast a student grasps concepts
  - Where they struggle
  - What type of questions confuse them

  Based on that, it will adapt the teaching method — whether it's breaking concepts down further, offering more visual explanations, or giving real-life analogies.

## 🚀 Why This Matters

Unlike other edtech giants (Byju's, PW, etc.), AI-Tutor is not just an online classroom. It's **truly personalized learning**, powered by AI that **learns how YOU learn**. Students will no longer be afraid to ask questions or feel left behind.

> "Every child learns differently. AI-Tutor learns how to teach each child differently."
